Installation
************
There are two ways to install the KUAVO Humanoid SDK:

1. Install from PyPI (recommended)
   
   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install kuavo-humanoid-sdk

2. **Or** install in development mode
   
   Clone the repository and install in editable mode:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      git clone https://gitee.com/leju-robot/kuavo-ros-opensource.git
      cd kuavo-ros-opensource/src/kuavo_humanoid_sdk
      pip install -e .

   This allows you to modify the source code and have the changes take effect immediately without reinstalling.
