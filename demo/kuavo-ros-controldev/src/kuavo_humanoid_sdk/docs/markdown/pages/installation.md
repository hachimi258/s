# Installation

There are two ways to install the KUAVO Humanoid SDK:

1. Install from PyPI (recommended)
   ```bash
   pip install kuavo-humanoid-sdk
   ```
2. **Or** install in development mode

   Clone the repository and install in editable mode:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitee.com/leju-robot/kuavo-ros-opensource.git
   cd kuavo-ros-opensource/src/kuavo_humanoid_sdk
   pip install -e .
   ```

   This allows you to modify the source code and have the changes take effect immediately without reinstalling.
