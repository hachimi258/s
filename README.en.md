Leju_Kuavo_Tongverse-Challenge-Cup-2025

Introduction  
Leju-Tongverse Simulation Platform  
A "AI + Robotics" virtual training arena that provides a safe and controllable simulation environment for embodied intelligence, enabling robots to fully prepare and train before facing real-world challenges.

Release Timeline  
1. By May 28th: Release of the robot simulation environment, allowing participants to debug robot control interfaces (e.g., basic mobility interfaces, arm planning interfaces).  
2. May 8th: Release of the competition simulation environment, including uneven terrain, stairs, slopes, and other challenge scenarios.  
3. June 5th: Release of a simplified example for simulating competition tasks.
